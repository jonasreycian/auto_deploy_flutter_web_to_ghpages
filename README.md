# CI/CD with Flutter Web and Github Pages

CI/CD is a means of delivering apps to clients more frequently by incorporating automation into the app development process. Continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment are the three key principles associated with CI/CD.

First, we have to create a flutter project. So open you terminal and execute the following command:
flutter create cicd_flutter_web_demo
This will create a new folder called cicd_flutter_web_demo in your current directory.
Go to the cicd_flutter_web_demo folder and execute the following command:
flutter run -d chrome
This will open a new window with the Flutter Web application.
Now we have to create a Github repository. So open your browser and go to your Github account and create a new repository.
The name of the repository should be cicd_flutter_web_demo.
Now we have to add the cicd_flutter_web_demo folder to the Github repository.
